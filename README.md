# Go Learning Repository

## Development Process
For theses exercises I used TDD (_Test-Driven Development_):
- First write failing test (e.g: integers/adder_test.go)
- Second write the function to make this test pass (e.g: integers/adder.go)
- Third refactor the code and make sure test is still passing (e.g: integers/adder.go)

## Topics
These exercises covers the topics: 
- unit tests
- data structure
- functions
- structs
- pointers
- object-oriented programming principles in practice
- mocking
- synchronized communication
- threads
- concurrency
- error handling

## Learning Resources

The main resources utilized for this project include the [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals) GitBook by Chris James and a course offered by the University of California, taught by Professor Ian Harris. These resources serve as a foundation for theory and practical implementation, enriching the learning experience.

Feel free to explore the exercises and code snippets within this repository as I progress through my Go learning process. Happy coding!
