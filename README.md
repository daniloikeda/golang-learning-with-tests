# GoLang Learning Repository

## Motivation

As a backend developer with a solid background in .NET, I found the need to expand my skill set by delving into GoLang. The motivation behind this project is to document and consolidate my learning journey in GoLang. By actively engaging in exercises and projects, I aim to enhance my proficiency in this language.

## Project Purpose

This project serves as a dedicated repository for storing exercises and practical implementations related to GoLang. The primary objective is to use these exercises as a hands-on approach to reinforce theoretical knowledge and build practical skills in GoLang programming.

## Problem Statement

The project addresses the need for comprehensive learning in GoLang, covering a wide range of topics. The exercises included in this repository span various aspects such as unit tests, data structures, functions, structs, pointers, mocking, concurrency, object-oriented programming principles in practice, error handling, threads, and synchronized communication.

## Learning Insights

Throughout the development of this project, I have gained valuable insights into the nuances of GoLang. The hands-on experience with diverse concepts has allowed me to deepen my understanding of unit testing, concurrent programming, and other critical aspects of GoLang development.

## Standout Features

What makes this project distinctive is its purely didactic nature. It's not just a collection of exercises, but a structured approach to learning GoLang with a focus on practical applications. The exercises are curated to cover a broad spectrum of topics, providing a holistic learning experience.

## Learning Resources

The main resources utilized for this project include the [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/go-fundamentals) GitBook by Chris James and a course offered by the University of California, taught by Professor Ian Harris. These resources serve as a foundation for theory and practical implementation, enriching the learning experience.

Feel free to explore the exercises and code snippets within this repository as I progress through my GoLang learning journey. Happy coding!
